# Basic portfolio
This is the first portfolio that I've approximately made in one day to have something. I **no longer use this one**
## The cool part
To make this portfolio at least a bit interesting, I've made an **animated background gradient**.
Codepen for just the background available [here](https://codepen.io/maximel-mrl/pen/GRYXNBr)
## Design and functionality
- Everything is integrated with no scroll and with modal navigation (so it won't reload)
- When switching modals the anchor is modified so we can reload and still be on the correct "page"
- there are two pages : one landing page and one carousel to present projects
